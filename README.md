# Priority Susceptibility of Critical Biological Areas in Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests

This project uses **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** to prioritize critical biological areas (CBAs) within the Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests based on their vulnerability to environmental stressors.

## Objective
To identify and classify areas most in need of monitoring and conservation by analyzing the intersection of:
- Transportation corridors
- Land cover change
- Critical Biological Areas (CBAs)

## Study Area
The project focuses on the **Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests** in Southern California — dynamic forest ecosystems affected by urban proximity, transportation networks, and climate variability.

## Tools & Techniques
- **GIS Tools:** ArcGIS Pro 3.3
- **Geoprocessing Tools:** Weighted Overlay, Raster Calculator
- **Data Sources:** USDA Forest Service, Land Use Zones, Land Cover Change Rasters

## Methodology
1. **Buffer Analysis:** Multi-ring buffers (100m to 1000m) for transportation and CBA features
2. **Raster Conversion & Reclassification:** For all datasets with priority scoring
3. **MCDA Techniques:**  
   - **Weighted Overlay:** Weights assigned as Critical Areas (50%), Land Cover Change (30%), Transportation (20%)  
   - **Raster Calculator:** Adjusted weights to refine output (CBA 40%, Land Cover Change 35%, Transportation 25%)

## Results
Identified 3 high-priority CBAs:  
  - **South Fork Rock Creek**  
  - **Upper Big Tujunga**  
  - **City Creek**
- These areas show strong intersection between all three criteria and are at high risk due to habitat fragmentation, CO₂ emissions, and land cover decline.

## Validation
Consistent results from both Weighted Overlay and Raster Calculator confirm the sensitivity and reliability of the model.

## Conclusion
The project highlights ecologically sensitive zones that require immediate conservation efforts. The results can support planners, biologists, and emergency services in targeted monitoring and resource allocation.
